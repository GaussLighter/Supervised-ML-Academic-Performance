# Supervised-ML-Academic-Performance

## Academic Performance through Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting & Stacking

### Overview

This repository provides an introduction to Supervised ML using Linear Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting & Stacking. The focus is on predicting academic performance of over 6,000 students thorugh analizing environmental factors. This project demonstrates how Supervised ML techniques can be used to draw inferences in the academic landscape.

## ðŸ”¥ Key Features

- **Linear Regression**: Explaining the variables with their purported significance.
- **Gradient Boosting**: Implementing a highly predictive non-linear model.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, normalization, and data splitting.
- **Visualization**: Graphs and charts to analyze stock trends and model performance.
